The following will introduce how to use Android APP to control the LinkNode R4.

## Steps

#### 1. Install Android and iOS APP
* Download the APK file from the [github](https://github.com/delongqilinksprite/LinkNodeR4-app.git) and install it.
* if your equipment is iphone/ipad,you can get the app form appstore and name is "LinkNode Relay".  
* iOS App download link ï¼š[LinkNode Relay](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/linknode-relay/id1163468201?mt=8)

#### 2. Login LinkSpriteIO

# How to update LinkNode R4 firmware
If you wipe the original firmware of LinkNode R4, you now need to restore the previous firmware, then follow the following steps can be restored.

* Download the [LinkNode R4 code](https://github.com/delongqilinksprite/LinkNodeR4-app/tree/master/code)
* Compile the code,this step can be learn from [LinkNodeD1](http://linksprite.com/wiki/index.php5?title=LinkNode_D1)
* Upload the code by Arduino IDE

###### Note: Apikey,deviceID and wifi message are written into the flash inside,if you want to erase the apikey and deviceID,you could change the code.but wifi message can't be erased!

* Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor,you will see "start to configure..."
* Use your cell phone scan the qr,get the akikey and deviceID
* send the deviceID and apikey by Serial Monitor,when you see "Configuration is finished!",that's done

###### Note: Scan QR result is:C1:0080000xxxx,D1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx,we just send:0080000xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx,no space.
